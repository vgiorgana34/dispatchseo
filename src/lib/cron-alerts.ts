// Cron failure alerts (LATER.md gap A4). Every cron route calls
// reportCronRun() with its result JSON right before responding; this module
// logs the run to cron_runs (migration 0020), and on a failed run emails the
// owner through Resend - debounced per job (24h for scheduled crons, so an
// hourly cron that stays broken sends one email, not twenty-four; none for
// deploy-check, where each run is a distinct human push). Cloud's customer
// emails carry a second, cross-job debounce keyed on the CAUSE - see
// customerCauseEmailedRecently. Every non-URGENT failure (see
// isUrgentCronFailure) additionally needs two consecutive failed runs before
// the first email - the same persistence bar the Home banner applies through
// criticalCronIssues, so the two rails always tell one story. The post-deploy
// smoke test (deploy-check route + .github/workflows/deploy-check.yml) rides
// the same rails: same run log, same banner, same email.
//
// Email is optional: without RESEND_API_KEY + ALERT_EMAIL the run log still
// works and the dashboard banner / get_cron_health tool carry the alert.
// Everything here is best-effort - a logging failure must never fail the
// cron itself.

// seo-daily last posts a real row the day the builder takes over, goes
// "overdue" 36h later, and stays on the banner forever while a guide ships
// every single day (seo-daily--mia-tax, 2026-08-09). The empty-queue gate

// this job's own staleness window is not late, it is superseded - clear the
// flag. Same contract as the idle gate: only ever CLEARS, never sets. The
// recency bound is what keeps it honest - a twin whose last real outcome is
// old fails it, so "nothing has built anywhere for days" stays exactly as
// loud as it was, and a twin that is failing or itself stale (the stuck-claim

 * does not email them. It stops running workflows. Every scheduled job simply
 * goes quiet, mid-month, and the repo looks fine.
 *
 * Without this, that arrives as several unrelated "job hasn't run since..."
 * rows and the owner goes hunting through workflow logs for a bug that does not
 * exist. The fix is a billing setting, so the alert has to say so - the
 * no-silent-failures rule: name what happened and link the way out.
 *
 * Deliberately a HINT, not a diagnosis: we cannot see another account's billing
 * page, so this fires on the signature (several scheduled jobs silent at once
 * on an account that plausibly exceeds the free tier) and says "likely". It is
 * additive - the individual stale rows still stand on their own - so being
