// Drains the background work queue (src/lib/jobs.ts, migration 0056).
//
// Everything the new article flow does off the request path passes through
// here: crawling a customer's site, finishing an accepted draft into
// publishable HTML, posting it, and checking afterwards that the page is
// actually live. One route rather than four, because they share every hard
// part - claiming without double-running, backing off, giving up loudly - and
// four copies of that is four places for the same retry bug.
//
// HANDLERS LIVE WITH THEIR FEATURE, not here. This route only knows how to
// hand a job to the right function and how to record what happened. The
// registry below is the entire coupling.
//
// Failure contract, matching every other cron in this codebase:
//   - One job failing must never stop the others. Each is isolated.
//   - A job that can still be retried is NOT an error: it is backed off and
//     the run stays green. Reporting a transient blip as a failed cron run
//     puts a banner on someone's dashboard for something that fixed itself
//     ninety seconds later, which is how alert rails get ignored.
//   - A job that has EXHAUSTED its attempts is a real failure and reports as
//     one, because at that point nothing will retry it and an article is
//     sitting unpublished with nobody watching.
